Fixed Income Fundamentals

1. Coupon
2. Payment Frequency
3. Cash Flow
4. Present Value of Money
5. Nominal Yield (Coupon)
6. Current Yield
7. Yield To Maturity (YTM) aka Yield
8. Cash Flow Discounting (Discount Factor)
8. Bond being traded > At Par / At Discount / At Premium

9. Weighted Average Life (WAL)

10. Maculay's Duration
11. Duration
12. Convexity

Pricing a bond :

1. $ Price_Today-> Yield(YTM) derivation
2. Yield (YTM) -> $ Price_Today derivation
3. Price derivation based on a Spread:
A Spread
J Spread
I Spread
N Spread
Z Spread

Fundamentals of Yield Curve (taking US Govt Tsy as example)

1. What is Yield Curve
2. Par Curve
3. Spot Curve aka Zero Curve
4. Forward Curve
>>> How Par , Spot , Fwd can be derived from each other

Fundamentals of Building Yield Curve to price FI instruments

1. As Risk Free instrument for building Curve why TSY is not used
--- Liquidity of instruments 
--- Instead Interest Rate Swaps (IRSwaps) are used

>>> Interest Rate Swaps IRSwap (Fixed Leg , Floating Leg )


2. Fundamentaly Yield curve has 2 components:

----- Forward Rate Curve - for cash flow projections
----- Discounting Curve - for cash flow Discountin

Industry standard till Global Financial Crisis (GFC) :
- Same curve LIBOR_3M was used for Forward Rate and also Discounting Cash Flow.

During GFC : new behavior pattenrs were observed 

>>>> Spread between LIBOR vs OIS (Overnight Index Swap)
>>>> Tenor basis swap 3m6m (0m->6m : Libor6m  is not more : 0->3Libor_3M + Libor3M_Fwd_3m->6m)  
>>>>>>>> concept of 3m6m (0m->6m : Libor6m approx to 0->3Libor_3M + Libor3M_Fwd_3m->6m + Spread)

3. Post GFC , New Multi-Curve concept emerged

---- Discounting : in theory - you can have more than 1 discounting curve , but mostly only 1 is used
>>>> OIS is used for cash flow discounting

---- Forward Rate : there is no 1 projected forward rate curve , as there will be multiple forward curves
LIBOR_1M fwd rate curve , LIBOR_3M fwd rate curve , LIBOR_6M fwd rate curve, ......
>>>> Mostly LIBOR_3M is used in USD market
>>>> Fwd rates for LIBOR_1M (LIBOR_6M) are adjusted using tenor basis swaps 1m3m (3m6m)
